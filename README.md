# N-in-a-row-Game
Using minmax algorithm to play N in a row game with a human player
and then compare the performance when we use AlpahBeta pruning and we don't use it. 
The Performance measurement here is based on the **number of board evaluations** not on milliseconds (which is so wrong Because then it's not machine independent).


The heuristic I implemented was **very simple**. It depended on the idea of how max number of player's chars in a row (Horizontally, vertically or diagonally).
Finally Tell me if you could beat the AI :)
